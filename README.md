# Assignement-2

The application first starts with the movies page. This page displays all the movies where you at first see the poster and the title of the movie.
There is also a details button that will open a modla that displays the dates and times that the movie has. 
In order to book a movie, you need to go to the screenings page. When there you can see all the movies sorted by date. You can also filter the movies by category.
If you click anywere on the table that displays information about the movie, you will be navigated to the booking page. 
Here you have a overview of the seats and which once are occupied and which once are free. 
You can select the seats that you want to book and then press the book seats button.
You will then get your ticket where you recieve information about price, date, time and a booking number. 

The application has a navbar that directs you to either the screenings page or the movies page. The movies page is based on three different components. 
The first on loops through all the movies. The second one displays the title and the poster of the movie. And the last one manages the modal. I believe that the way 
these components are set up is good because it is easier to read and understand the code. 
The other pages are based on a single component wich makes it harder to read and understand the code. A example of this is the screenings component which is very 
larg. There are a lot of code that represent different parts of the page. If i were to redo the assignement i would divide this page into more individual components 
in order to make it easier to understand and modify. The ticket and BookingPage components are not as big and complicated but i could also divide these once into more
individual components. 

All in all, i believe that this was a good assignement as a first project in react. I learned a lot and now know what i need to do in order to make my next project better.
